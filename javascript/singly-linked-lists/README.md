# Singly Linked List

A singly linked list is a linear collection of data where each piece of data is represented as a 'node'. The first node in a linked list is refered to as the head, and each node has reference to the next node in line with it's 'next' property. This challenge required the creation of methods that could insert a new node to the beginning of the line, check to see if a value exists in the list, and can write out all the values in the list in a readable way.

## Challenge

- Node
  - Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
- Linked List
  - Create a Linked List class
  - Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
    - Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
  - The class should contain the following methods
    - insert
      - Arguments: value
      - Returns: nothing
      - Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
    - includes
      - Arguments: value
      - Returns: Boolean
        - Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
    - to string
      - Arguments: none
      - Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
        - "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

## Approach & Efficiency

- .insert()
  - Approach: Create a new node with the value provided, if the head currently does not have a value - make the input value the head of the list. If a head already exists, set the 'next' of the new node to the existing 'head', then set the head to the new node.
  - BigO: O(1)
- .includes()
  - Approach:Set the current variable to the current head, while a current value exists, compare the input value to the current. If the values match, return true, else set the current to the 'next' of the current so that we traverse down the list. Keep comparing values and if there is no match, return false.
  - BigO: O(n)
- .toString()
  - Approach: Set a variable to an empty string, then while a current value exists, add the value of the current node to the string. Traverse down the list, adding the values to the string as you go. Once at the end of the list, return the string + 'NULL' (to depict that the last node 'next' points to null).
  - BigO: O(n)

## API

- .insert(): takes in a value and adds it as a new node to the beginning of singly linked list.
- .includes(): takes in a value and returns 'true' if it exists in a singly linked list.
- .toString(): returns a string representing all the values in a singly linked list.
